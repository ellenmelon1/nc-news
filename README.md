# Welcome to Northcoders News!

The project is a full stack application inspired by Reddit. Users can find articles that interest them by sorting by topic and display order, comment and vote on articles, and remove their comments and votes. The frontend is built in React using Tachyons and vanilla CSS for styling. It's connected to an API also built by myself and hosted on Heroku.
